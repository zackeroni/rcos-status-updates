# Week 11 Status Update

So this week I've been building my creature to present. I cannot find a list of every ID currently being utilized in mySQL for the server. When I tried to create 
a new ID I would get an error that it was taken. Since I am still creating for the overarching purpose of learning and not publishing required content I think it 
will be ok to just overwrite another creature and hijack its ID. The final creature in the creature list is the Monsterous Ooze. I can just change everything about
it and use its model for my creature. The thing now is what makes a "boss". Bosses are just creatures with more events. I could take the time to add a ton of events
but that just seems time consuming and does not show additional mastery of mySQL over showcasing a couple. I think it is more important to try and show off a fully 
functioning product in every aspect. My problems right now is getting it to spawn in the correct location. I can spawn the creature in manually but I would like the 
set spawnpoint to work so the server spawns it at the desired location.

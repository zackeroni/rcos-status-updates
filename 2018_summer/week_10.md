# Week 010 Status Update

So I can't figure out printing to the in game console. I have the correct file where .gm fly on command should be placed being level3.cpp. There is a skeleton of someone's
basic structure for the repetitive parts but none of the implementation. Unfortunately, not being able to print to the console is stopping me pretty early on. I also have no
idea how to check flags on entity's or players. So when I try to set the swimming flags to true I do not know if they are actually working. Due to the end of the semester
approaching I think I will start to focus my effort on building a custom boss instead. It seems that there is c++ code present for bosses from the first expansion present. 
This is weird since this is the vanilla recreation. For vanilla bosses and other creatures are all lumped together with their mechanics being handled by mySQL as far as I 
can tell. So my goal for this upcoming week is to further understand MySQL and figure out how I can use the tables to create a creature worth showing off at the end of the semester.
This happens to line up well with my presentation. I plan to do it on how to host a server using mySQL. So I will hopefully learn information for both topics while reading and watching
tutorials for mySQL.

# Week 05 Status Update

I have encountered quite a blocker. The executable that is supposed to run my server is not working. I have gone through the instrcutions several times and asked people
on the discord for help. Unfortunately, the error message is super generic and they can't really diagnose what is wrong either. I had to delete several .dist extensions from .conf files.
I think it is likely that I deleted one that I was not supposed to. The instructions keep referencing my  "server folder" and I do not know which folder that is yet. It is extremely
demoralizing to have my progress halted by not what I wanted to work on, but software not functioning together as I believe it should.

# Week 07 Status Update

Professor Turner to the rescue! He saw that I was having trouble and sat down with me to help troubleshoot programs he knew nothing about. When he noticed the executable 
was failing to even start when launched he suggested a program called Dependancy Walker. This allowed us to see that some dependencies were not within the folder that they were
supposed to be. From square one we restarted making the server in a brand new folder. I got up the point I was before with some assistance from him and now the executable for the
server runs successfully! Now, I just need to be able to connect to my server from the client.

# Week 04 Status Update

I have now downloaded and installed all of the software that I believe I will use for this project. This week I am working on getting a server 
for the World of Warcraft game client running on my computer. Having a functoining server will allow me to test features in game as well as gather 
data from the console anout actions in the world. There is a lengthy tutorial written on how to do it. Unfortunately, it is serveral years old aand software has been updated.
Not just 3rd party software but even several of the MaNGOS executables. I am stumbling my way through it. According to other users on the MaNGOS discord I do not have to use all
of the previous, old software. Newer updates will only improve my experience. I just have to work my way through the new interfaces and options.

# Week 02 Status Update

For week 2 I joined RCOS and decided upon my project. I have decided to make modification to a custom serverside implementation that aims to mimic the original server source code for 
classic World of Warcraft. I have found a community of people online who have created software calledthey call MaNGOS (Massive Network Game Object Server Suite) that I will use in order
to modify code. The exact modifications and upgrades that I intend to implement will be outlined in my proposal.
